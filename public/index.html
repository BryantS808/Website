            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Bryant. I am from Mililani, Hawaii, which is on the island of Oahu. I love video games, swimming, bowling, archery, watching anime and movies, and gardening. Likewise, I am currently in Corvallis, studying at Oregon State University. This webpage is just stuff about me, from more formal information and projects to just anything I like and feel like talking about.</p>

                        <li>Officer</li>
                        <p>At OSU, I have been and member and intern officer for the JSA. Being a part of JSA has been one of my greatest moments in college and even life. 
                            During my time as an officer, I learned a great deal about how running a club works, while also having a ton of fun as well. 
                            I learned effective event planning, fundraiser coordination, better communication skills, adapting to random and spontaneous issues, and so much more. 
                            The greatest and most accomplishing show of these skills was putting on our culture show J-Night. J-night is an annual culture show we put on for 300 people. 
                            Putting on the show required a bunch of coordination and communication between, school organizations, outside performers, faculty, members, volunteers and of course between officers.
                            I learned a lot about and improved on my communication, organization, problem-solving, time management, adaptability, and leadership. 
                            The JSA has not only made my time at OSU awesome, but also improved me as a person. I am thankful to the members, officers and various organizations and staff that helped me along the way.
